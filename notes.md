This is my notes file
#Midterm review:

- **link element** specifies a relationship between the current document and an external resource. Most commonly used to link to stylesheets but also for linking to favicon icons among other things.
- **div tag** a generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS, such as direct styling of some kind of layout model like Flexbox.
- **title tag** is required, gives page a title. #title can search for a title id when used with JavaScript, .grid would search for a CSS class
- **padding** is the first layer out from an object, **margin** is the third, after the **border**.
- **arrow functions** are a compact alternative to a traditional function expression. They dont have their own bindings to this, arguments, or super, should not be used as method. Cannot be used as constructors. Cannot be created as generators, don't use yield. Sort of like a python lambda. Syntax is declaring parameter, then arrow to what to do with parameters.
- The **# selector** looks for ID's in elements.
- **HTML tags** - "<p>","<ol>", "<ul>" "<h2>", "<h1>", "<h3>" 
- **JSON** is the Java Script Object Notation file, it works like a dictionary but is a standardized format for sending, receiving, and storing data.
- **web certificate** is necessary for HTTPS.
- pwd = print working directory, ls = list the directory contents, vim = VI improved, nano = another text editor, mkdir = make directory, mv = move, rm = remove, man = manual for Linux commands, cd = change directory, ssh = secure shell protocol for remote access and file transfer, ps = lets you see the processes running on your system, wget = used to retrieve content and files from various web servers, sudo means run as admin
- **ls -la** will list hidden files too
- **subdomain.(root(secondary.top)**
- **Port 443** is used for HTTPS, **80** is used for HTTP, and **22** is for SSH
- DNS points to an IP address, not another A.
- You can use Object.create() or just declare the context and set up the key - value pairs.
